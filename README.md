# Overview:
The project involves the creation of a database management system named StudentRecordsMgmt to efficiently manage student data, course details, and their enrollments. It includes tables for storing student information, courses, and enrollments, along with appropriate relationships and constraints.

# Key Activities:
Database Creation: Designed and created the database StudentRecordsMgmt with three tables: Students, Courses, and Enrollments.
Table Structure Definition: Defined table structures with appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints (e.g., unique email).
Data Insertion: Populated the tables with sample data for students, courses, and their enrollments.

# Queries and Updates:
Performed queries to join tables and retrieve combined data (e.g., grades by course).
Updated and deleted records, such as modifying grades and removing a student.
Calculated average grades for courses using conditional logic.

# Technology Used:
Database Management System: MySQL
Query Language: SQL
Key Features Used:
AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and UNIQUE constraints.
SQL JOIN for combining data across tables.
Aggregate functions like AVG() and CASE statements for data processing.

# Key Insights:
Data Integrity: Ensuring referential integrity through foreign keys prevents invalid relationships between tables.
Query Efficiency: SQL joins and conditional logic are powerful tools for extracting meaningful insights from relational data.
Error Prevention: Defining constraints (e.g., unique email) mitigates data duplication and inconsistencies.
Flexibility: The system allows easy updates, deletions, and modifications to records without disrupting the overall database structure.
